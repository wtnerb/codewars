# Counting duplicates
This is a solution to the problem found here: https://www.codewars.com/kata/counting-duplicates/train/python

As I am learning python, I am solving some basic coding challenges to get used to the syntax. This kata is a learning exercise and TDD practice.

The basic idea of the kata is to count the number of items in a string that are duplicated at least once. Only count alphanumeric, and be case insensitive.
