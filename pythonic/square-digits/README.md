# Square Digits

This is a python solution to a challenge from code wars. This challenge can be found at https://www.codewars.com/kata/546e2562b03326a88e000020/train/python

Two solutions are provided. `square_digit1` is my first solution, trying to make sense of things and likely the one I would commit to a work codebase.

`square_digit2` is where I tried to stretch my knowledge of python syntax to compress the whole algorithm to a single line.

After submission, I looked at the submissions on Code Wars and it is clear that the python community agrees: `square_digit1` is best practice and `square_digit2` is clever but not best practice. Admittedly, the "official" version of `square_digit1` is slightly cleaner, but the idea is right.
