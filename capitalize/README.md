https://www.codewars.com/kata/alternate-capitalization/train/javascript

This challenge was to alternately capitalize letters in a string and output the two resulting strings in an array. Ex: 'abcddd' => ['AbCdDd', 'aBcDdD']

Solving the problem with regex and the replacer method ballooned into an incredibly hard to read one-liner. it worked, but an easier to read solution is included.
