# my head is on the wrong end
### 301 day 2 challenge

the challenge was to reverse a three item array. I happened to know the array.reverse() method already, so my first try at the kata was trivial. Further kata solutions were because a twenty second solution is just not satisfying.

The whiteboard has four workable ideas, although only three are in solutions I actually wrote.
