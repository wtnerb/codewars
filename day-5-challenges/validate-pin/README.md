# Validate PIN
## 301 day 5 challenge

This challenge was meant to validate a given string as an acceptable PIN. PINs had to be 4 or 6 numeric digits. All other lengths, character types, things not strings had to return false.

I had solved this challenge about a month before it was assigned, so there is a solution for doing it that way and more recent solutions included.
